# Lean UX
## Basics
- **Design Thinking**: solve problems by using design methods
- **Agile Development + Product Design**
  1. Individuals and interaction over processes and tools &rarr; engage the entire team!
  2. Working Software over comprehensive documentation &rarr; find most viable Product according to market fit and viability
  3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation &rarr; leads to a shared understanding
  4. Responding to change over following a fixed plan &rarr; also requires constant adjustments to fit the solution to the market
- **Minimum Viable Product**
  - Iterative approach: *build &rarr; measure &rarr; learn*
  - Reduce waste by measuring **real customer feedback**
  - Find a *hypothesis*, leading to an *MVP* which is then validated with *customer feedback*

## Principles
- **Cross Functional Team**: Diverse team made up of different roles with the goal to reduce gated handoff "waterfall" &rarr; Insight is brought from various disciplines per idea
- **Small, Dedicated, Colocated**: Small teams in one location to enhance focus, comoraderie, and to make it easier to keep current on status changed and learnings.
- **Progress = Outcomes; not Output**: Features and services are output. outcomes are the business goals they achieve.
  - If features do not perform well, a decision can be made on whether to keep going or change.
- **Problem focussed Teams**: Assign whole business problems to teams instead of small parts.
  - Produces a sense of *pride* and *ownership* and *unique solutions*
- **Remove Waste**: Only goal is improved outcomes &rarr; removed waste allows teams to be more agile and keeping focussed
- **Small Batch Size**: Avoid inventory of untested features. Waiting inhibits learning from feedback and will lead to unused or idle assets.
- **Continuous Delivery**: Engage thers throughout the process &rarr; enhance understanding *what* users do with the Product and *why* they do it.
- **Getting out of the Building (GOOB):** The answers about user needs are not solved in meething rooms.
  - Test ideas early to find out if they miss the market &rarr; customer decided in the end and earlier feedback helps you
- **Shared understanding**: More understanding inside of the team leads to less second hand reports and detailed documents being needed.
- **Anti Pattern: Rockstars and Gurus**: Team cohesion breaks down if you add individuals with big egos wanting to stand out, leading to less collaboration and shared understanding.
- **Making over Analysis**: Make ideas concrete to be able to gather feedback.
- **Learning over growth**:Do not scale unproven ideas &rarr; waste of time and resources.
- **Permission to fail**: Having safe environments leads to people trying out more experimental ideas.
  - Enhanced creativity and iterative processes lead to higher skill & knowledge
- **Get out of the deliverables Business**: Documents do not solve customer issues. Good products do.
  - Used artifacts do not matter.
  - Quality of the product measured by customer and market reaction is all that matters.

## Vision Framing and Outcome
Starting point for a project is the **hypothesis**.
- **Assumption**: High level declaration of what we believe.
  - Common starting point declared as a team.
  - Reveal divergence of opinions in a team.
  - Broad set of possible solutions.
- **Hypothesis**: Granular description of *assumptions* in specific areas of the product or workflow.
- **Outcomes**: Signal we seek from the market to (in)validate the *hypothesis* - either *qualitative* or *quantitative*.
- **Personas**: Models of the people we believe we are solving a problem for.
- **Features**: Changes or improvements driving the outcome we seek.
